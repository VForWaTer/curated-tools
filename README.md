# Curated tools

This repository contains a curated list of tools developed in the V-FOR-WaTer project.  
The tools are implemented following the V-FOR-WaTer [tool specification](https://vforwater.github.io/tool-specs/).

The list of tools is available in two formats: 

* [tool-list.txt](./tool-list.txt) as a plain text file. This can be used to load a list of all toolboxes in code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VForWaTer/curated-tools/main/tool-list.txt
* [tools.csv](./tools.csv) as a CSV file with some more metadata.
